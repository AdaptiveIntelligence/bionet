C. elegans specific utilities:
connectome: create bionet network from connectome.
behavior: bionet sinusoidal movement (locomotion) behavior.
undulationFFT: Fourier Transform analysis of C. elegans undulation muscle activation.
wrigglenet: evolve networks that "wriggle" in response to touch stimuli.
